        <b>About:</b> Akash Levy is an EE Ph.D. student at Stanford University, supervised by Prof. Priyanka Raina. Previously, he was a Research Intern at Amazon Lab126 and Amazon Web Services. He received a B.S.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 2018, with certificates in Applications of Computing and Engineering Physics. He is a recipient of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.<br>
        <b>Research:</b> His current research is focused on improving the efficiency of reconfigurable logic devices (such as FPGAs and CGRAs) through the use of 3D integration with emerging nanotechnologies. In particular, he is developing a hybrid design that makes use of both resistive random access memory (RRAM) and nanoelectromechanical (NEM) relays to implement reconfigurable switching in the back-end-of-line for reduced reconfigurability overhead. His goal is to enable reconfigurable logic devices to become more competitive with ASICs in terms of power, area, and performance. His pre-PhD research involved a broad range of subjects, ranging from physics to computer security.

        <b>About:</b> Jackson Melchert is an EE Ph.D. student at Stanford University, supervised by Prof. Priyanka Raina. He received a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in 2019.<br>
        <b>Research:</b> His research focuses on how to generate an optimal coarse-grained reconfigurable array processing element (PE) architecture for a given application domain. He is developing tools to analyze the applications that are going to be run on the CGRA to identify interesting PE architectures to be evaluated. He is also developing a PE generator that takes a high level specification of a PE from the application analysis and produces the hardware description of the PE, along with functional and formal models used in the application mapping process. Jack is broadly interested in optimizing configurable hardware to approach the performance and efficiency of application-specific accelerators.

He received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering Honors and a B.A. in Plan II Honors (Liberal Arts) from The University of Texas in 2018.<br>
        <b>Research:</b> My current research focuses on automatically mapping applications, ranging from machine learning to image processing, onto reconfigurable logic devices (CGRAs). Previously, I helped design and tape-out a DNN accelerator utilizing resistive memory (RRAM) for low-energy inference and training. This chip exploited the low read cost and non-volatility of RRAM to store the weights of a DNN model, providing a low energy solution for edge and IoT devices. Broadly speaking, I am interested in improving the hardware design flow and developing highly performant and flexible hardware.
