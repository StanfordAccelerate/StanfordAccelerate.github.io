He is a recipient of 2016 IEEE EDS Masters Student Fellowship.  
**Research:** My research is focused on in-memory computing enabled by emerging non-volatile memory technologies. The application space ranges from deep learning inference (DAC'19) to hyper-dimensional computing (IEDM'16, ISSCC'18) for cognitive applications, while leveraging the unique physical characteristics of emerging devices (e.g., stochasticity, 3D vertical connectivity). I also collaborate closely with Prof. Subhasish Mitra (Stanford) and Prof. Jan Rabaey (UC Berkeley).

**About:** Weier Wan is an EE Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University, supervised by Prof. H.-S. Philip Wong and co-advised by Prof. Priyanka Raina. Previously, he was a Research Intern at Google X. He received M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 2017, and B.S. in Electrical Enginnering and Computer Science and B.A. in Physics from UC Berkeley, in 2015.  
**Research:** My research focuses on using resistive memory (RRAM) based analog in-memory computing to enable energy and area-efficient machine learning. Recently I designed and taped-out (and currently testing) a fully-integrated mixed-signal chip with RRAM synapses monolithically integrated with CMOS neurons. The chip implements inference and training for Restricted Boltzmann Machine, a type of probablistic graphical model, as well as inference for MLPs and RNNs. The project is a collaborative effort with Prof. Gert Cauwenberghs (UCSD) and Prof. Huaqiang Wu (Tsinghua University). I also studied novel techniques for quantizing deep neural networks (<https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/cnn_quantization>).

He received a B.S.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 2018, with certificates in Applications of Computing and Engineering Physics. He is a recipient of the 2018 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.  
**Research:** My current research is focused on improving the efficiency of reconfigurable logic devices (such as FPGAs and CGRAs) through the use of 3D integration with emerging nanotechnologies. In particular, I am developing a hybrid design that makes use of both resistive random access memory (RRAM) and nanoelectromechanical (NEM) relays to implement reconfigurable switching in the back-end-of-line for reduced reconfigurability overhead. My ultimate goal is to enable reconfigurable logic devices to become more competitive with ASICs in terms of power, area, and performance. My pre-PhD research involved a broad range of subjects, ranging from physics to computer security.

**Research:** My current research focuses on automatically mapping applications, ranging from machine learning to image processing, onto reconfigurable logic devices (CGRAs). Previously, I helped design and tape-out a DNN accelerator utilizing resistive memory (RRAM) for low-energy inference and training. This chip exploited the low read cost and non-volatility of RRAM to store the weights of a DNN model, providing a low energy solution for edge and IoT devices. Broadly speaking, I am interested in improving the hardware design flow and developing highly performant and flexible hardware.
