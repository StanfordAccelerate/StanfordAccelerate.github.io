### Akash Levy

**Email:** akashl AT stanford DOT edu     
**Webpage:** <https://www.linkedin.com/in/akashlevy/>  
**About:** Akash Levy is an EE Ph.D. student at Stanford University, supervised by Prof. Priyanka Raina. Previously, he was a Research Intern at Amazon Lab126 and Amazon Web Services. He received a B.S.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 2018, with certificates in Applications of Computing and Engineering Physics. He is a recipient of the 2018 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.  
**Research:** My current research is focused on improving the efficiency of reconfigurable logic devices (such as FPGAs and CGRAs) through the use of 3D integration with emerging nanotechnologies. In particular, I am developing a hybrid design that makes use of both resistive random access memory (RRAM) and nanoelectromechanical (NEM) relays to implement reconfigurable switching in the back-end-of-line for reduced reconfigurability overhead. My ultimate goal is to enable reconfigurable logic devices to become more competitive with ASICs in terms of power, area, and performance. My pre-PhD research involved a broad range of subjects, ranging from physics to computer security. For more details, please refer to my [Academia.edu portfolio](https://stanford.academia.edu/AkashLevy) and my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A0Auh6EAAAAJ&hl=en).  

### Kathleen Feng

**Email:** kzf AT stanford DOT edu  
**About:** Kathleen Feng is an EE Ph.D. student at Stanford University, supervised by Prof. Priyanka Raina. She received a B.S.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 2018, with certificates in Applications of Computing and Robotics and Intelligent Systems. She is a recipient of the NDSEG Fellowship.     
**Research:** My current research focuses on accelerating deep image processing pipelines (ISPs) on reconfigurable hardware. Deep ISPs combine low-level image processing techniques with high-level image classification, allowing for a more robust process. More generally, I am interested in designing and developing new computer architectures for computer graphics, vision, and related applications.  

### Jackson Melchert

**Email:** melchert AT stanford DOT edu  
**About:** Jackson Melchert is an EE Ph.D. student at Stanford University, supervised by Prof. Priyanka Raina. He received a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in 2019.  
**Research:** My research is currently focused on how to generate an optimal coarse-grained reconfigurable array processing element architecture for a given application domain. I am developing tools to analyze the applications that are going to be run on the CGRA to identify interesting PE architectures to be evaluated. I am also developing a PE generator that takes a high level specification of a PE from the application analysis and produces the hardware description of the PE, along with functional and formal models used in the application mapping process. I am broadly interested in optimizing configurable hardware to approach the performance and efficiency of application specific accelerators.

He received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering Honors and a B.A. in Plan II Honors (Liberal Arts) from The University of Texas in 2018.  
**Research:** My current research focuses on automatically mapping applications, ranging from machine learning to image processing, onto reconfigurable logic devices (CGRAs). Previously, I helped design and tape-out a DNN accelerator utilizing resistive memory (RRAM) for low-energy inference and training. This chip exploited the low read cost and non-volatility of RRAM to store the weights of a DNN model, providing a low energy solution for edge and IoT devices. Broadly speaking, I am interested in improving the hardware design flow and developing highly performant and flexible hardware.
